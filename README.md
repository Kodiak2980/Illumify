This extension is a fork of Darkreader

This extension **inverts brightness** of web pages and aims to **reduce eyestrain** while browsing the web.
Currently a team of 4 Marquette Seniors are working to add new features such as dyslexia fonts, changable font
size on webpages, and colorblind correction. Our hope is that we can create an extension that helps our users
take care of their eyes and makes the internet more accessible. 

### How to Contribute

We are currently not looking for contributors actively as this is a university capstone project, but check back in early 2019 for updates.
